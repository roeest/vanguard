# vanguard
A golang wrapper for querying vanguard API

I was playing around with vanguard API to query various ETFs. Couldn't really
find any relevant docs so got the data from F12 to see how their site queried
the API. I only extracted the fields that I was interested in so there's a lot more
data available. Usage is demonstrated in examples folder.
